                    <h3>Proposal Summary</h3>
                    <p>The project aims to address episodic flooding of culturally significant sites on Saibai Island through rapidly deployable, modular flood barriers. These temporary structures provide immediate short-term protection during king tides and storm surges, particularly for the cemetery, school access roads, and south-east township areas.</p>

                    <h3>Overview of Design</h3>
                    <p>The modular flood barrier system achieves flood protection through interlocking plastic panels that form a temporary wall with raised edges for enhanced sealing and stability. Implementation is supported through community-led deployment protocols developed in consultation with Torres Strait Island Regional Council (TSIRC) and local Elders.</p>

                    <p>The design includes the following physical components:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                        <li>High-density polyethylene (HDPE) modular panels (100cm x 50cm x 50cm)</li>
                        <li>Interlocking top and bottom connectors</li>
                        <li>Ergonomic handles for manual transport</li>
                        <li>Anti-slip adhesive base strips</li>
                        <li>Central drainage grooves</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Who will use this design?</strong> Community members and TSIRC maintenance crews will deploy barriers during flood alerts. Elders and cultural custodians guide placement near sacred sites to ensure cultural appropriateness.</p>

                    <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                        <li>Materials sourced from mainland Australia (Warringah Plastics, Sydney) with transport via Cairns</li>
                        <li>Maintenance requires rinsing, gasket inspection, and storage in labeled crates</li>
                        <li>Deployment requires 1-hour setup time by small community teams</li>
                        <li>Further consultation with Saibai Elders required to finalize cemetery placement protocols</li>
                        <li>Next steps include pilot deployment and community training workshops</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Proposed Materials and Cost Summary</h3>
                    <p><strong>Purchased Materials:</strong> 600 recycled HDPE panels, anti-slip adhesive strips, protective storage crates</p>
                    <p><strong>Other Materials:</strong> Transport containers, deployment tools, training materials</p>
                    <p><strong>Estimated Total Cost:</strong> $48,000 - $55,000 AUD (approximately 150,000 - 175,000 PGK)</p>

  <h2>1. Project Details</h2>
  
  <img src="images/qld-saibai-island-l.jpg" 
       alt="Map of Saibai Island" 
       class="responsive-image">

  <p>Saibai Island, located in the Torres Strait north of Queensland, faces frequent flooding due to its extremely low elevation and exposure to king tides. Despite the construction of a 2.2 km seawall in 2017 costing $23.8 million, several key areas, particularly the local cemetery remain unprotected and continue to experience tidal inundation and erosion. Flooding has damaged graves, displaced tombstones, and caused loss of cultural heritage.</p>

  <p>The cemetery holds deep cultural and spiritual importance for the Saibai community, serving as a place of ancestral connection and continuity of Ailan Kastom traditions. Protecting this site is therefore both an environmental and cultural priority.</p>

  <p>Climate change has intensified the island's vulnerability, with rising sea levels and stronger storm surges increasing damage risk. Large-scale seawalls are costly and unsuitable for sacred areas, highlighting the need for flexible, community-based, and environmentally sensitive solutions.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <h3>Project Context</h3>
    <p>Saibai Island faces frequent flooding caused by storm surges, king tides, and rising sea levels. Although a seawall was built in 2017, many areas, especially the south-eastern township and the culturally significant cemetery remain unprotected.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Design Area and Project Opportunity</h3>
  <p><strong>Design Area 3.2:</strong> Infrastructure - Temporary flood mitigation structures</p>
  <p>Consider durable, rapidly deployable designs that provide short-term protection against flooding, particularly during extreme weather events, storm surges, or seasonal high tides. These could be particularly useful in areas such as the southeastern portion of the township or the culturally sensitive cemetery.</p>

  <h3>Needs Statement</h3>
  <div class="info-box">
    <p>Saibai Island in the Torres Strait is experiencing ongoing problems with flooding and erosion. The island sits only a few metres above sea level, which makes it extremely vulnerable to high tides, storm surges and the effects of climate change. Flooding regularly damages homes, roads and important community facilities while also threatening local water and food supplies.

Existing flood defences such as small embankments and temporary seawalls have not been effective. They break down over time and are expensive to maintain, leaving the community exposed to further damage. A stronger and longer lasting solution is needed that is affordable and practical for Saibai’s remote location.

To meet this need, the project focuses on developing a lightweight plastic flood barrier. The design uses vacuum pressure thermoforming to create panels that are durable, resistant to saltwater and easy to install and maintain. This approach aims to improve flood protection for the island’s residents and safeguard the community’s infrastructure and way of life for the future.</p>

                <p>Saibai Island, located in the Torres Strait, is a low-lying community that faces frequent flooding caused by high tides, storm surges, and heavy rainfall. These events have a major impact on the island's infrastructure, homes, and daily life. Flooding also disrupts access to essential services, damages local ecosystems, and poses risks to community health and safety. Because of its remote location, finding reliable and sustainable solutions is especially important for the people of Saibai.</p>

                <h2>3. Problem Description</h2>

                <p>It's clear that Saibai Island is extremely vulnerable to outside forces with its low elevation, limited disaster funds, and a weakening natural environment caused by global warming. Before we can design a solution, it's important we understand the true severity of these factors, to see just how ongoing and serious this problem really is.</p>

                <p>Saibai lies only a few kilometres from Papua New Guinea, and most of the island is less than two metres above sea level. According to the Torres Strait Regional Authority, sea levels in this region are rising between 6 and 8 millimetres per year, almost triple the global average. In 2015, a $24 million seawall and flood barrier was built to protect the community. But only six months after its completion, storm surges breached the barrier, flooding parts of the island once again. This highlights how even newly built defences are struggling to withstand the pace and force of rising tides.</p>
                <div class="image-placeholder">
                     <img src="images/9355463d123a294584cc39f8972dabad.jpg" 
         alt="Cemetery flooding during a king tide on Saibai Island" 
         class="responsive-image">
                </div> 

                <p>During king tides, saltwater regularly floods roads, homes, and gardens, causing land degradation and erosion. Even the island's cemetery has been repeatedly submerged headstones are eroding, and families worry about the resting places of their ancestors. Elders have described this as heartbreaking, saying it feels like "losing part of our culture and identity."</p>

                <p>Much of Saibai's land is made up of mangroves and swamp, which makes it highly sensitive to flooding and erosion. Rising seas kill vegetation, contaminate drinking water, and damage gardens. The gardens play a huge part in Saibai culture, where older Indigenous peoples continue to teach how to grow crops like cassava, taro and bananas. These crops are used in culturally significant customs like Ailan Kastom, meaning to connect to the land, sea and spirit. According to locals, increasing waterlogged conditions are slowly contaminating the gardens, causing a shift away from their cultural heritage.</p>

                <p>Because materials are difficult to transport to such a remote location, hundreds of kilometers from any ports or major cities, repairing damaged infrastructure takes time and resources that are not always available. This means even relatively small floods or storm surges can leave long-lasting impacts on homes, roads, and community facilities.</p>

            <!-- SOLUTIONS PAGE -->
            <div id="page-solutions" class="page">
                <h2>3. Design Solution Options</h2>

                <p> In developing a defensible design response for Saibai Island, we first articulated the problem space with precision: episodic, short-duration inundation driven by king tides and storm surge intermittently compromises critical access and culturally significant sites, specifically the school access road, the south-east lowlands, and the cemetery. We then operationalised the brief for Design Opportunity 3.2 into an evaluative framework comprising six criteria: affordability, durability/adaptability, simplicity, rapid deployability, suitability for temporary/short-term application, and maintainability each weighted for near-term decision utility. This framework underpinned a comparative assessment (decision matrix) of four concept families and exposed the trade-offs inherent in speed of deployment, hydraulic efficacy, lifecycle burden, and place-specific constraints (transport, storage, community operation).</p>
    <h2>3.1 Design Criteria</h2>

                <div class="criteria-list">
                    <div class="criteria-item">
                        <h4>1. Affordability</h4>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Total cost the community must carry, including capital outlay, transport/staging costs, event activation costs, and routine upkeep over 3–5 years.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Budgets are finite and freight is expensive; a solution that is cheap to buy but costly to move/store or activate shifts burden to council crews and households. Lower lifecycle cost = more frequent, reliable protection.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="criteria-item">
                        <h4>2. Durability & Adaptability</h4>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Structural robustness through repeated uses and the ability to conform to different geometries (straight runs, corners, undulations) without specialist re-engineering.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Frequent failures or "one-site-only" designs create downtime and stranded assets; adaptable systems deliver value across the school road, south-east lowlands and cemetery with the same kit.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="criteria-item">
                        <h4>3. Simplicity</h4>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The fewest steps, tools and judgments needed to deploy and recover the system safely.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Community crews operate under time pressure; simpler systems reduce errors, injuries and supervision needs, and speed up re-opening of roads and sites.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="criteria-item">
                        <h4>4. Rapidly Deployable</h4>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Time from trigger to protection in place for a 30–120 m line, including transport from storage.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Early hours drive most damage and access loss on Saibai; speed determines whether school and services remain functional.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="criteria-item">

                    <h3>Selected Solution and Justification: Temporary & Demountable Barriers</h3>

<h3>Photovoltaic Pump ❌</h3>

<p>For Photovoltaic pump, this idea uses solar panels to power a submersible pump that moves pooled water after a tide or storm.</p>

<p>On affordability, the parts are many (panels, controller, pump, long hoses), and cleaning the intake adds running cost.</p>

<p>For durability and adaptability, the electrics cope with salt only if cared for, and the intake can clog; the system also works only at low points and cannot shape to doors or road edges.</p>

<p>It is not simple to use because crews must site the rack, prime the pump, place a screened intake, and watch the flow.</p>

<p>It is not rapidly deployable, since it protects only after water arrives and output drops in cloudy, windy weather.</p>

<p>It is temporary in the sense that it can be removed, but it does not block inflow.</p>

<p>Maintenance is high because the intake and hoses need frequent cleaning and checks.</p>

<h3>Permeable Pavement ❌</h3>

<p>For permeable pavement, this is a fixed surface that lets water pass into a base layer to reduce ponding.</p>

<p>It is expensive to build on an island because it needs demolition, new base material, and heavy freight, so affordability is limited.</p>

<p>It is durable when loads are right, but adaptability is low because it is tied to one site and cannot be moved to the next hotspot.</p>

<p>It is simple on the day of a flood—there is nothing to set up—but building it is complex civil work.</p>

<p>It is not rapidly deployable, since it cannot be rolled out for a 1–3-day event.</p>

<p>It is not temporary; it changes the ground and is hard to reverse near sensitive places.</p>

<p>Maintenance needs vacuum cleaning to stop pores from clogging with sediment and salt, which means special equipment must come to Saibai.</p>

<h3>Ecosystem Adaptations ❌</h3>

<p>For Ecosystem adaptations, planting saline-tolerant mangroves or building up dunes can cut wave energy and give many social and environmental gains.</p>

<p>Costs are modest for plants and care, so affordability is fair, and once established the systems are very durable.</p>

<p>Adaptability is guided by nature: they must be placed where the shore and soils allow, not where a door line or road edge demands, so they cannot "bend" to fit tight geometry.</p>

<p>They are simple to look after once they take, but permits and biosecurity steps add effort at the start.</p>

<p>They are not rapid, because living systems need seasons to grow and cannot protect the next 1–3-day event.</p>

<p>They are permanent landscape measures, not temporary kits.</p>

<p>Maintenance after year one is light, with small infill and weeding after storms.</p>

<h3>Temporary & Demountable Barriers ✅</h3>

<p>For Temporary & demountable barriers, this is a modular kit that interlocks to make a short wall with raised edges for a better seal.</p>

<p>It is affordable to stage because it is bought in pieces, stacks well for freight, and needs only a small team to use.</p>

<p>It is durable and highly adaptable: the modules are tough, the joints form corners and returns, and the same kit fits the school road, the south-east area, and the cemetery.</p>

<p>It is simple: place, interlock, seat the edge, and check the seal—no specialist trades.</p>

<p>It is rapidly deployable and can be in place within the first hour after a tide alert, so it blocks inflow rather than moving water later.</p>

<p>It is truly temporary, sitting on pads with no digging, and it leaves the site as it was.</p>

<p>Maintenance is light—rinse, inspect gaskets and joints, restack in labelled crates—so readiness stays high.</p>                </div>

            <!-- DETAILED DESIGN PAGE -->
            <div id="page-detailed" class="page">
                <h2>4. Detailed Design</h2>

                <div class="image-placeholder">
                     <img src="images/boxwall.webp" 
         alt="Boxwall Diagram" 
         class="responsive-image">
                </div> 

                <p>When discussing mobile flood barriers, we're specifically referring to modern approaches like Bluemont's Boxwall Flood Barrier that use the weight of the water being redirected to self-anchor and create a stronger barrier wall. These structures are reasonably cost-effective for mitigating flood damage, and their modular nature means simple maintenance or hot swapping of components.</p>

                <p>For the residents of Saibai Island, this means being able to mitigate escaping flood water and the potential damages to those key and culturally valued structures such as the cemetery. Additionally, during off-flood times the culture and history built around these structures won't be disrupted by these barriers due to their temporary nature: there are no fixed elements that would alter how the residents approach these structures in their day-to-day lives.</p>

                <p>By having these wall-like flood barriers in place, transportation around the residential areas, certain structures, and some roads remain accessible to a degree, facilitating the coordination of supplies to support areas in need. This opens several development opportunities that were previously disrupted by flood management, such as the improvement of early warning systems, building key infrastructure, or further developing fixed flood mitigation options. They aren't a complete replacement for current flood mitigation options but rather a complement that alleviates some pressures and allows more time for their development.</p>

                

                <h3>Design Features</h3>
                
                <h4>Updated Dimensions: 100cm x 80cm x 50cm</h4>
                <p>Further research into Saibai's torrential flooding revealed extensive flooding and erosion at Saibai's cemetery wall in addition to meteorological data, citing Saibai's peak rainfall of 135.8mm this year alone, according to Australian Meteorology. A thickness of 5mm was settled, the industry standard for most barriers. While some can be as thin as 1.5mm, given the plastic construction we'll be working in - not metal sheets - 5mm was what was decided.</p>

                <h4>Ergonomic Handling</h4>
                <p>The handle was retained, but widened to 10cm in width, allowing them to be held by the handle in a two-handed grip in the event that a stack needed to be moved. This, and the model's lightweight make as per its plastic construction - an estimated ~6 kg, makes this design rapidly deployable in the event of flooding.</p>

                <h4>Managing Waterflow</h4>
                <p>Rounded edges were added to multiple points in order to reduce hydrodynamic stress and improve water flow. A second groove was also added, done to accommodate for greater load bearing during peak periods of rainfall, as well as to improve drainage capacity, with the semi-circular tube design acting as makeshift pipes. Finally, while not strictly part of the prototype's model design, the final implementation would see tarpaulin overlaid between joints to prevent leakage.</p>

                <h4>Additional Stability</h4>
                <p>A top connector point was added to improve structural stability through 2 points of connection and reducing wobble when placed upon uneven terrain, such as the unpaved ground surrounding the local cemetery. This would also reduce the risk of separation during flooding periods while allowing for modular linking. Finally, anti-slip adhesive strips were added to the base to increase friction with the ground, helping anchor the board and minimize water infiltration.</p>

                <p>This refined design allowed us to evaluate the prototype's efficiency under simulated conditions and identify its scalability for larger flood-prone areas.</p>

                <h3>Addressing Community Concerns</h3>
                
                <p>One of the largest issues surrounding Saibai Island's development is flooding, especially during extreme weather events, storm surges, and seasonal high tides. To address this issue, we designed our solution to be a rapidly deployable flood barrier that provides immediate short-term protection against flooding, removing the unnecessary time needed to fully construct a flood barrier during floods (such as a sandbagging method).</p>

                <p>Additionally, the plastic injection molded design allows our solution to be as cost-effective as possible with materials while also being durable against flood waters, opening the opportunity to stock up on more units. With the modular nature of these barriers in combination with cost-effectiveness, maintenance is simplified to swapping out damaged barriers and either replacing or repairing them to extend their lifetime.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, our solution meets the needs of Saibai Islanders in a culturally appropriate manner by complementing existing temporary and fixed flood mitigation structures. Specifically, it protects the culture and history of key structures within the township from escaping flood waters and prevents potential flood damage from taking significant resources for repair.</p>

                <p>During off-flood times, our solution won't disrupt the culture and history surrounding these structures because they are completely removable with no fixed elements that may alter the way the islanders would approach certain structures. This is further emphasized by the overall design that enables barriers to be stacked on top of each other, which significantly assists with transportation and storage.</p>

                <p>Finally, by instating the use of these barriers, transportation around structures and the residential areas of the township remains accessible to a degree, facilitating the circulation of support around the island during floods. This availability for transport, alongside resources made available by the cost-effectiveness of these barriers, opens opportunities for development in other aspects of the island worth investing in, such as building more key infrastructure or improving the seawall to secure the island's future.</p>

                <h3>Testing Methodology</h3>
<p>Planned testing of the design's load-bearing capacity and leakage control under king-tide conditions is segmented into digital simulation, succeeded by real-world evaluation within a controlled environment. A simulation within SolidWorks will aid in assessing the effects of hydrostatic pressure, helping identify areas of potential structural bulging and refine material distribution before physical fabrication. The prototype will then be tested at the Manly Hydraulics Laboratory, a specialist facility offering controlled flood simulation environments, allowing for accurate observation of the design's performance under real-world tidal conditions.</p>

<div class="criteria-list">
    <div class="criteria-item">
        <h4>SolidWorks Simulation Analysis</h4>
        <p>Initial SolidWorks simulation applied hydrostatic pressure equivalent to one meter of standing water (9810 N/m²). Testing was performed on a flat vertical panel of similar thickness to illustrate pressure distribution across the surface—intensifying toward the base. Red arrows (representing force vectors) increase in size with depth, while the blue gradient shows bulging under load. Although the L-shaped geometry and double-groove design weren't included in this preliminary test, the visualized deformation offers a useful approximation. Bulging remains within manageable bounds, suggesting material viability under flood conditions typical to Saibai Island. Future simulations will incorporate the complete structure and anchoring system to validate long-term performance and leak resistance.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="criteria-item">
        <h4>Wave Basin Testing (Multidirectional Flow)</h4>
        <p>The prototype will undergo physical testing at Manly Hydraulics Laboratory using the Wave Basin facility (30 m × 20 m × 1 m) featuring a random, multidirectional wave generator. This setup is ideal for simulating pooled tidal surge and chaotic floodwater flow—particularly relevant for modeling Saibai Island's king tide pooling during high-rainfall events. The barrier will be secured along a perimeter, with pressure, overtopping, and deformation responses monitored under various wave heights and frequencies to assess real-world performance.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="criteria-item">
        <h4>2D Wave Flume Testing (Linear Impact)</h4>
        <p>The 2D Wave Flume (30 m × 1 m × 1.8 m) will enable controlled, linear wave impacts against the prototype's upright face. This setup allows precise measurement of structural flex, leakage along the barrier seam, and uplift forces on the anti-slip base. High-speed cameras and in-line sensors will provide deformation data, leak initiation points, and stress propagation through the groove system, offering critical validation of the interlocking mechanism's performance under sustained pressure.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="criteria-item">
        <h4>Future Design Iterations</h4>
        <p>Future iterations will explore integration with biodegradable tarps and coral-aggregate concrete for hybrid natural–engineered resilience. Additional enhancements, such as hemp-fiber reinforcement and localized material sourcing, will improve both sustainability and cultural compatibility with Saibai Island's environment. These developments aim to create a more ecologically integrated flood defense system that works in harmony with the island's natural ecosystem.</p>

            <!-- IMPLEMENTATION PAGE -->
            <div id="page-implementation" class="page">
                <h2>6. Implementation Plan</h2>

                <h3>Implementation Site: Saibai Cemetery</h3>
                
                <div class="image-placeholder">
                    <img src="images/cemet.jpg"
                    class="responsive-image">
                </div>

                <p>Located west of the township, the site has an area of approximately 500 m² and a perimeter of 300 m. It holds profound cultural, spiritual and community significance, representing connections to Ancestors, Country, and Ailan Kastom traditions. Despite the construction of a 2.2 km seawall in 2017 costing $23.8 million, the cemetery continues to experience flooding during every king tide, which causes erosion of the shoreline and the washing away of wooden frames and tombstones.</p>

                <p>Some graves are no longer identifiable, making flood protection a matter not only of safety but also of cultural preservation. This site was selected because it highlights the urgent need for temporary, low-cost flood protection that respects cultural values and environmental sensitivity.</p>

                <h3>Governance and Coordination</h3>
                
                <p>Implementation will be jointly coordinated through the Torres Strait Island Regional Council (TSIRC) and the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA).</p>

                <div class="criteria-list">

                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Thermoforming of recycled HDPE sheets</li>
                    <li>CNC trimming and finishing</li>
                    <li>Quality inspection under ISO-certified standards</li>
                    <li>Assembly of interlocking mechanisms</li>
                    <li>Application of anti-slip base strips</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Finished products will be transported via road freight to Cairns, then shipped by barge to Saibai Island. Each barrier weighs around 6 kg, allowing efficient manual handling and community-based deployment without heavy machinery. This lightweight and modular design minimizes environmental disturbance during installation and simplifies storage after use.</p>

                <h3>Community and Cultural Collaboration</h3>
                
                <p>Implementation must follow a culturally sensitive and community-driven approach:</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li><strong>Elder Consultation:</strong> Local Elders and cultural custodians will be consulted before installation to ensure appropriate placement around sacred areas</li>
                        <li><strong>Traditional Ecological Knowledge:</strong> The project incorporates TEK developed over thousands of years to guide design, placement, and maintenance strategies</li>

                            <p>Our group divided the project based on each member’s strengths and prior experience. Cameron W focused on the website design and project details, using Claude.AI for support with layout and structure. Jonathan H worked on the background research and recommendations. Gayan P developed the prototype and detailed design, drawing on his previous experience in this area. Yunxuan H was responsible for the implementation and cost analysis, where he had prior knowledge and skill. King L contributed to the design solutions and overall project structure, ensuring the website followed a similar format to our previous presentations for consistency and clarity.</p>

                            <p>A digital simulation was completed in SolidWorks to see how the design would perform during flooding. The test applied water pressure equal to one metre of standing water (9810 N/m²) on a flat panel made from the same material. The results showed that pressure increased toward the base, causing slight bulging that stayed within safe limits.

While the full L-shaped design and double-groove seal were not included in this first test, the results showed the material could handle typical flood pressures on Saibai Island. Future simulations will include the full structure, anchoring system, and groove joints to better test leak prevention and long-term performance.</p>
